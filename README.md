## Getting started
You’ll need the following dependencies before getting started.

- Ansible
- Homebrew

At the time of writing it’s possible to get all three like so:

```
xcode-select --install
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install ansible
```

## How to run with a one-liner
